Various scripts written in Bash to automate tasks that I perform regularly. I have tried to make them as compatible as possible with modern distributions based on Debian and/or Ubuntu. The scripts are in Spanish because is my native language, sorry.

If there is any error or you have an improvement idea, please open a ticket.
