Various scripts written in Bash to automate tasks that I perform regularly. I have tried to make them as compatible as possible with modern distributions based on Debian or Ubuntu. The scripts are in Spanish because is my native language, sorry.

If there is any error or you have an improvement idea, create an issue.

**Note:** Please, don't create issues related to interim releases of Ubuntu or the testing branches on Debian. I don't support them.
